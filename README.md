# staticPortfolio.github.io

This is a copy of my personal website I made in my Senior year of high school.

It used to be live on the domain **ezeude.ca** but not anymore.

You can see what it looked like using the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20220203153008/http://ezeude.ca/).

Unfortunately the Site Capture doesn't work properly anymore. ;(

But you can see the live site on [Github Pages](https://dezeude.github.io/staticPortfolio.github.io/)

Enjoy!
