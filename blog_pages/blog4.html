                        Above, is a picture of an OpenGL quad, consisting of 2 triangles and a minecraft grass block texture with some other coloring texture.
                        Behind the window, is my fragment shader in the Eclipse IDE.
                        The reason I wanted to learn OpenGL is because I wanted to learn more about 3D graphics and rendering.
                        My goal is to learn enough OpenGL to the point where I can make my own game and/or game engine from scratch.
                        The reason I'm not using a game engine is because I want to actually understand what goes on behind the scenes
                        in software and the GPU when a 3D game is running. I've been learning OpenGL mostly from <a href="https://learnopengl.com/">learnopengl,</a>
                        and it has been an exciting and fulfilling experience. The biggest challenge I have though, is that the website is taught using C++,
                        but I'm using Java. You would think that this wasn't a big deal, but the OpenGL API is different in both langauges, for example in the C++ API,
                        pointers are used as parameters and the method/function will change the values of those variables, but Java is call by value, not call by reference,
                        so I had to do some research, and in those cases I needed to use Java Buffer Objects like FloatBuffer and DoubleBuffer objects. Regardless,
                        I am enjoying the experience and the challenges I face make the project more fun when I solve them.

                    Above is a video of what I have done so far in OpenGL. I followed the tutorial that was previously mentioned, and
                    I created a few cubes with ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting and/or maps. The light source is the white cube, and
                    the light emitted off of it is reflected off the metal part of the cubes using a specular map. The green letters is a
                    texture used as an emmission map, which simulate a glowing effect.
